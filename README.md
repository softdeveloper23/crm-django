# My Django Project

This is a brief description of my Django project, detailing its functionality and purpose.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and get the project running.

### Setting up a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies separately from your system's Python installation.

- For Unix/Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env

  For Windows:
bash
py -m venv env

Activating the virtual environment
Activate the virtual environment to use it for installing dependencies and running the project.
On Unix/Linux/macOS:
bash
source env/bin/activate

On Windows:
cmd
.\env\Scripts\activate

Installing dependencies
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the Django project locally, execute the following command:
bash
python manage.py runserver

This will start the development server, allowing you to access the project in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
